# ripple-client

> Ripple client with Vue.js and Webpack

This is a simple Ripple client, loosely based on [https://github.com/jatchili/minimalist-ripple-client](https://github.com/jatchili/minimalist-ripple-client).

The goal is to make dependencies transparent and auditable.

**This project is in an experimental stage** - uses Websockets and the Ripple REST API.
